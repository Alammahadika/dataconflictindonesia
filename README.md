# SOCIAL CONFLICT IN INDONESIA 
From R-Studio, this project tries to do a new innovation analysis of social conflict in Indonesia, collecting conflict data from [The Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/ucdp-data-for-indonesia), and this project also explains a little about social conflict in Indonesia by region. I hope this data becomes an open source for peoples.
